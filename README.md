Authentication and Authorization: Implementing user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to resources. This includes features such as user registration, login, logout, and access control based on user roles and permissions.

Database Management: Integration with a database management system to store and manage application data. This involves features like CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to interact with the database, data validation, and ensuring data integrity.

API Endpoints: Creation of RESTful API endpoints to expose functionality and data to the frontend or other services. These endpoints handle incoming HTTP requests, perform necessary operations, and return appropriate responses, typically in JSON format.

Middleware: Utilization of middleware functions to handle tasks such as request processing, error handling, logging, authentication checks, and data validation. Middleware sits between the incoming request and the route handler, allowing for modular and reusable code.
